->Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation and optimization of a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn. It covers both a basic decision tree model and an optimized version using pre-pruning and post-pruning techniques to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

->Concepts Covered

Decision Tree Classification,
Gini Impurity,
Train–Test Split,
Overfitting in Decision Trees,
Pre-pruning vs Post-pruning,
Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV,
Model Visualization.

->Tech Stack

Python,
NumPy,
Pandas,
Matplotlib,
Scikit-learn.
